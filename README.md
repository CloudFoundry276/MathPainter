In this project, we use canvas library.

We get width, height and color of canvas to create canvas from user.

After getting canvas input data, user will give input to draw the shape he/she want to draw i.e. rectangle or square.

If shape is rectangle, then input will be x and y co-ordinates, width and height, and RGB values for color.

If shape is square, then input will be x and y co-ordinates, length of side and RGB values for color.

After getting all required input data from user, shape will be drawn.
